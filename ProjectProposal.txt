StuySMS: Student Management System (or “StuySOS: Stuyvesant Student Organization System”)
By Emily Redler & Tiffany Ming 

Team Name: “You Had Me At ‘Hello World’”

Description: A way for educators to organize their classes and student info (or make up their own, in the case of bored students)

Main/ Minimum Features:
add students to a seating chart
Implementation: 2D arrays
x & y coordinates correspond with row and col of student in array
can click and drag to rearrange
take attendance
variable to keep track of number of clicks on certain student (holding the key won’t change the color, but releasing it after holding it for a long time will change color once)
numClicks%4 (or however many mode/colors there are) will tell studentBox (the box the student is in) what color to be
read the date to mark the absence/lateness in a calendar
click on a student and see info about them (grades, absences/lates, etc.)
add grades for a student
Implementation: add to an array of grades
calculate student grades
Implementation: Just average the grades (or weight certain areas more than other, i.e. tests can count more than homework)

Goal Map:
create main file (add setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), keyReleased() and other such functions)
create Student class 
variables: 
String name
int numLate, numAbsent
ArrayList<Integer> gradesList
maybe make a type “grade” to hold grade type, value, etc. and put those in gradesList
methods:
accessor and mutator methods
calcGradeAv()
calcHomeworkAv(), calcTestAv(), etc.
addGrade(int g, String type)
make seating chart 
make it draggable/droppable
prettify

Extra Features:
graphs (of student progress, of class attendance, etc)
Maybe after certain amount of latenesses, cuts, or absences (excused or otherwise) extreme cut on grade or some sort of penalty
Administrator account/login (you can’t look at other user’s students’ info)
