Java Tutor (“A Byte of Java”?): an educational tool for beginners (no prior experience) to help learn Java
by Emily Redler & Tiffany Ming

Minimum Features
-> has interactive lessons (~10?) where you click and drag methods into place and have drop-down, scroll-through, etc. menus for variables
-> have helpful error catching and explain what’s wrong (without letting the program crash) and how to fix it (don’t just give them the answer)
-> user input for variable names, choose the right operator, etc.

Extra Features
-> sandbox mode (free-for-all coding)
-> achievements
-> accounts (to track progress)
-> mini-games (find the error, etc.)
-> unlock new methods/projects

Goal Map 
1. create readable building blocks of language
2. implement user input
3. make building blocks draggable/droppable
4. create interface
5. plan lessons
6. create lessons
7. deal with error-catching
8. make hints
9. prettify
10. create sandbox mode
11. file creating/reading of user accounts to store info
12. create achievements
13. create mini-games
14. make unlockable methods/projects
15. prettify/finalize

Difficult features
-> creating our own “language” that reads the blocks the user uses, and translates that into Java code 
-> possibly animating whatever “code” the user inputs
