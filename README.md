*How to Branch: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
Don't know if this'll help: https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/
Hmm, maybe this: https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches

Note for My Group:
I got branching and merging to work by:
*(commit changes)
*git checkout [name of branch you want to merge with master]
*git merge master
(links above say to checkout to master then merge with branch, but that doesn't work for some reason :/)
*DON'T FORGET TO PUSH CHANGES!!!
